			(ɔdɔyewu)
			Never really felt like this
			I'm head over heels but my heart says i like this
			My muse it's for you that I write this
			You make a G send out sappy emojis
			Forever yours, chivalry is alive and for you I will open doors
			Yours truly and i'm truly yours
			What you made me see a love supreme never seen before
			So when each morning whispers
			You're still the only one on my wish list
			Took me just one take to tell you I'll do what it takes
			You're the best part of my day everyday so...
		</p>

			(Ahuɔfɛ dua)
			Shea butter smooth skin, gap tooth
			24 karat smile ohhhhh
			I go love you die, i'm a die hard fan
			Before the day is done let's go meet the fam
			Confessed my love for you to the ancients
			You're my oracle when i'm chased by agents
			Nerd-life, er er um Jesus
			See how a goddess got a god mc speechless
			Solomon and Sheba, Darius and nina
			They got nothing on us our love jones deeper
			When you hear my after nine voice in your speaker
			Then lights please, eureka
			My only task is to kiss you and ask...
		</p>

		I knew it was special right from the start
		Way more than the physical baby you touched the heart
		Yes you did
		So i don't wanna waste no time
		I don't wanna waste your time girl
		I wanna make you mine
		I wanna make you mine

		
		<h3 id="Chorus 3">Chorus J Something (Mi Casa)</h3>
		Will you be my woman, be my woman (forever)
		Will you ( i really wanna make you mine) be my woman be my woman
